        An attempt to import blueprint for '%{descriptor}' finds it already exists.
        Moving on.
      spaces::models::thing/open_struct_from_json: |
        The blueprint for '%{descriptor}' is not well formed.
        Results are unpredictable.

    engines::emitting::emissions::transformable/stanzas_for:
      engines::emitting::emissions::transformable/_stanzas_for:
        Method '%{method}' is not defined in '%{klass}'.
        Assuming this is correct; returning an empty Array

    engines::packing::pack/auxiliary_texts:
      engines::packing::pack/division_scripts: |
        There are no images given in the blueprint for '%{identifier}'.
        So there's nothing to pack.

    engines::packing::space/block_in_by:
      engines::packing::space/save: |
        There are no images given in the blueprint for '%{identifier}'.
        So there's no worthwhile pack to save.

    engines::packing::space/block_in_execute_on_anchors_for:
      engines::packing::space/by: |
        A %{klass} for %{descriptor} is yet to be saved.
        Saving now.

    engines::packing::space/block_(2_levels)_in_execute_on_anchors_for:
      engines::packing::space/execute: |
        There are no images given in the blueprint for '%{identifier}'.
        So there's no worthwhile pack to %{command}.
      engines::packing::space/by: |
        A pack for %{descriptor} is yet to be saved.
        Saving now.

    engines::provisioning::space/apply:
      engines::provisioning::space/execute:
        Provisioning failed while attempting to execute %{command} for %{identifier}.

    engines::provisioning::space/plan:
      provisioning::space/execute:
        Provisioning failed while attempting to execute %{command} for %{identifier}.

    engines::emitting::emissions::descriptive_subdivision/resolution:
      engines::resolving::space/by: |
        A resolution for %{identifier} is yet to be saved.
        Saving now.

    engines::emitting::emissions::divisible/new:
      engines::emitting::emissions::divisible/initialize: |
        Malformed %{klass} declaration in %{blueprint} blueprint.
        Ignoring %{content}

    engines::emitting::emissions::divisible/check_subdivision_class:
      engines::emitting::emissions::divisible/subdivision_class: |
        There is no source code for subdivision class %{klass}.
        Substituting OpenStruct.

    engines::emitting::emissions::divisible/subdivision_class:
      engines::emitting::emissions::divisible/const_get: |
        There is no source code for subdivision class %{klass}.
        Substituting OpenStruct.

    spaces::models::space/open:
      spaces::models::space/initialize:
        An instance of %{klass} for %{identifier} does not yet exist in its space.

    spaces::interpolating::infix/resolved:
      spaces::interpolating::infix/_resolved:
        Unable to resolve text infix for %{value} in %{text}.
