      spaces::spaces::git::space/import: |
        An attempt to import blueprint for '%{descriptor}' finds it already exists.
        Moving on.
      spaces::spaces::models::thing/open_struct_from_json: |
        The blueprint for '%{descriptor}' is not well formed.
        Results are unpredictable.

    spaces::engines::packing::pack/auxiliary_texts:
      spaces::engines::packing::pack/division_scripts: |
        There are no images given in the blueprint for '%{identifier}'.
        So there's nothing to pack.

    spaces::engines::packing::space/block_in_by:
      spaces::engines::packing::space/save: |
        There are no images given in the blueprint for '%{identifier}'.
        So there's no worthwhile pack to save.

    spaces::engines::packing::space/rescue_in_by:
      spaces::engines::resolving::space/by: |
        There is no resolution saved yet for the pack for '%{identifier}'.
        Saving now.

    spaces::engines::packing::space/block_in_execute_on_targets_for:
      spaces::engines::packing::space/by: |
        A %{klass} for %{descriptor} is yet to be saved.
        Saving now.

    spaces::engines::packing::space/block_(2_levels)_in_execute_on_targets_for:
      spaces::engines::packing::space/execute: |
        There are no images given in the blueprint for '%{identifier}'.
        So there's no worthwhile pack to %{command}.
      engines::packing::space/by: |
        A pack for %{identifier} is yet to be saved.
        Saving now.

    spaces::engines::arenas::space/chdir:
      spaces::engines::arenas::space/block_in_execute:
        Provisioning failed while attempting to execute %{command} for '%{identifier}'.

    spaces::engines::transforming::divisions::divisible/new:
      spaces::engines::transforming::divisions::divisible/initialize: |
        Malformed %{klass} declaration in %{blueprint} blueprint.
        Ignoring %{content}

    spaces::engines::transforming::divisions::divisible/check_subdivision_class:
      spaces::engines::transforming::divisions::divisible/subdivision_class: |
        There is no source code for subdivision class %{klass}.
        Substituting OpenStruct.

    spaces::engines::transforming::divisions::divisible/subdivision_for:
      spaces::engines::transforming::divisions::subdivision/prototype: |
        There is no source code for subdivision class %{klass}.
        Substituting OpenStruct.

    spaces::engines::transforming::divisions::targeting_subdivision/resolution:
      spaces::engines::resolving::space/by: |
        A resolution for %{identifier} is yet to be saved.
        Saving now.

    spaces::spaces::models::space/open:
      spaces::spaces::models::space/initialize:
        An instance of %{klass} for %{identifier} does not yet exist in its space.
